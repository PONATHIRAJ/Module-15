# Ex. No: 15A - Build a Binary Tree consist of a root, left and right node.

## AIM:
To write a Python program to build a binary tree with a root, left, and right node using floating-point values.

---

## ALGORITHM:

1. **Start the program.**
2. **Import** the `Node` class from the `binarytree` module.
3. **Create a root node** using the `Node` class and assign a floating-point value.
4. **Create left and right child nodes** for the root with float values.
5. **Convert the tree** to a list and print the list of nodes.
6. **End the program.**

---

## PYTHON PROGRAM

```
from binarytree import Node
l=[]
for i in range(3):
    x = input()
    l.append(x)
print("Binary Tree :")
for i in l:
    print(i,"--> ",end = "")

```

## RESULT
Thus the Python program to build a binary tree with a root, left, and right node is successfully verified successfully.
